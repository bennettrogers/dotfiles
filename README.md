Fonts

* Operator Mono is patched using the font-patcher script from Nerd Fonts with the --complete flag
* The resulting Italic fonts all have the same PostScript font name, so [this script](https://gist.github.com/keighl/5434540) was used to set the PostScript names to something sensible (have to set the filenames to something sensible first).
