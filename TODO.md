* Fix
  * starting vim seems to kill my tmux statusline formatting (italics)
    * look at tmuxline configs for how to set this (as well as color themes)

* make sure certain things are installed:
  * silver searcher
  * neovim

* things to change
  * try using vim8.0 with https://github.com/maralla/completor.vim
