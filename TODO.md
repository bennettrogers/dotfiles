* Fix
  * cursor should be a bar in Tmux
    * currently it starts as a bar, but starting/stopping vim changes it to a block
  * colors aren't working in vim/sync.sh (so probably broken elsewhere)

* make sure certain things are installed:
  * silver searcher
  * neovim

* things to change
  * try using vim8.0 with https://github.com/maralla/completor.vim
